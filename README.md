# Simple-DarkSouls-Soul-Counter
Simple counter for souls in board game of Dark Souls 
It traks your souls!
'p' and '+' adds to your souls (enter after p or + then type number of souls)
'm' '-' and 'o' decreses your souls (enter after m or - or o then type number of souls)
'c' and '=' shows your current number of souls
's' adds 8 souls to your counter (our choise of souls after a room you can change the number and complile the code if you like)
'd' is in case you die (so never!) it sets your souls to 0 and after you recover them press 'd' again and it will add them back to the counter (For now I didn't code case if you die twice without recovering them, it didn't happend to us so I didn't bother. I may add that later)
